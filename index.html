              <p>  I was born in England, at Lakenheath Air Force Base. At age of 3,
                  moved to the US. Living at various Air Force bases. My family settled in Tucson, AZ
                  when I was 6 years old. Tucson is where I grew up and currently live. 
              </p>


              <p>  I have spent the last 30 years working in many different forms of retail. I 
                  went to school for Fashion Design and Merchandizing, while working in a grocery
                  store. I have been working in the fashion industry for 20 years, managing my
                  own store for the last 16 years. At the end of 2016, my store was closed by the company. 
                  I realised that this was an opportunity to get into a different industry, one that 
                  has a stable and growing future.
              </p>

              <p>  I currently live with Shawn, my youngest son Patrick, and 3 of the best dogs ever! My 
                  youngest son, is attending community college and working at Starbucks. Sal and Sophie are
                  both Dachsunds with funny personalities. Sophie is my dirty little princess, humans were 
                  put on this earth to meet her needs but if she finds anything remotely dirty or stinky, 
                  she will roll in it. Sal is my happy clown, always a goofy happy dog but an omega in 
                  every sense of the word. Shady is a large black Lab/Blue Healer mix. She is a big lovey,
                  who talks to you if she has something to say. If I could talk dog, we would have long 
                  conversations about philosphy.  </p>
